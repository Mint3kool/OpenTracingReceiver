# OpenTracingReceiver

Sister repository for my OpenTracing implementation. This repository could be run standalone by running API calls, but it wouldn't be actively carrying context across different process boundaries.

All instructions are in the primary repository's README: https://github.com/Mint3kool/OpenTracingDemo
